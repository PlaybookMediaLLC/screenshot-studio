      <h1>Screenshot Studio: Free Screenshot Editor and Mockup Maker</h1>
      <p>
        Screenshot Studio is a free, open-source screenshot editor that runs
        entirely in your browser. Drop in a screenshot and turn it into a
        professional graphic: add a gradient background, wrap it in a Safari or
        Chrome browser mockup, tune the padding, corner radius, and shadow,
        tilt it in 3D, then export a PNG, JPEG, WebP, MP4, WebM, or GIF. Editing
        runs on your device and imported images are not uploaded to edit them;
        only export compression sends the finished image to the server, which
        returns it without storing it.
        A signed-in workspace is required. A free plan is available, while some
        workspace capabilities require a higher plan. The editor does not add
        watermarks to exports.
