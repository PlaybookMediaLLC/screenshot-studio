# Cookie Policy and privacy choices (draft)

> **DRAFT — requires counsel review.** Not legal advice. Do not publish. Shots has no cookie policy
> and no privacy choices control in code today. Code baseline: commit `bad06b3e`.

## Summary

- Shots targets US customers only (owner decision, 2026-10-17). US law uses an opt-out model, not
  an opt-in banner.
- Shots uses a few necessary cookies for sign-in, and browser storage for the editor.
- Google AdSense on public content pages counts as "sharing" or "targeted advertising" under US
  state laws. Visitors need a way to opt out, and the site must honor Global Privacy Control.
- Product change P1 adds these controls. Do not publish this policy before P1 ships.
- The `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie in the live Privacy Policy is not in this list. The code does not set it.

## Privacy choices requirements (product change P1)

1. Add a **Your Privacy Choices** link to every footer. The link opens a panel where a visitor can
   opt out of "sale", "sharing", and targeted advertising.
2. When a visitor opts out, or the browser sends a Global Privacy Control signal, show only
   non-personalized ads, or no ads. Do not load personalized ad cookies.
3. Keep the choice for the browser, and for the account when the visitor is signed in.
4. PostHog: if the PostHog contract makes PostHog a service provider, analytics is not a "sale".
   `[[COUNSEL: confirm, and decide whether the opt-out also turns off PostHog]]`
5. Visitors from the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland: Google requires a Google-certified consent
   platform for ads shown to them. Turn on Google's consent message for those regions in the
   AdSense console, or do not show ads there. `[[OWNER: choose]]`
6. Record each opt-out with its time and source (link or signal).
