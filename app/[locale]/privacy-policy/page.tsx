            <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              Screenshot Studio combines a browser-based image editor with a
              workspace platform. An account and workspace membership are
              required to use the editor. We store the identity, session,
              membership, and workspace data needed to provide that service.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              Editing, compositing, and preview rendering happen on your device
              in the browser canvas. Several operations do send data off your
              device. Account and workspace operations, export compression, URL
              capture, tweet import, and remote-image import send the data needed
              for those operations to our servers or the named providers below.
              We do not sell your data.
