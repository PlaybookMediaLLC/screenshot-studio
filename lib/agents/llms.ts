> Shots is an open-source launch platform. It reads a software release, writes a cited launch brief, designs on-brand visuals, and drafts posts, and nothing ships until a person approves. It also includes a screenshot editor and browser-based image tools in every plan. Every plan is paid, and a signed-in workspace with an active subscription is required for everything; exports have no watermark.

## Overview

The launch platform turns a release (typed in, sent through the API, or delivered by a GitHub, GitLab, or custom webhook) into a launch brief where every claim cites a source, a campaign plan, visuals rendered with the workspace brand kit, and channel copy. Every post needs a human approval before it can be scheduled. Launch intelligence is in early access for design partners: ${BASE_URL}/design-partners.

The screenshot editor is included in every plan, with no watermark. Editing runs in the browser: imported images are not uploaded to edit them, saved designs are stored in the workspace, and export compression round-trips the finished image through the server without storing it. It is an open-source alternative to Pika Style, Shots.so (a separate product), and CleanShot X.

## Key Features

- ${atLeast(PRODUCT_FACTS.backgrounds)} gradient, mesh, and solid backgrounds
- Safari and Chrome browser mockups (light and dark)
- Device frames: Arc, Polaroid, glass, outline, border
- 3D perspective transforms and shadow effects
- ${PRODUCT_FACTS.animationPresets} animation presets with keyframe timeline editor
- Video export in MP4, WebM, and GIF
- Text and image overlays with ${PRODUCT_FACTS.fonts} Google Fonts
- Tweet-to-image and code-snippet-to-image capture
- On-device AI background remover with full-resolution transparent PNG output (${BASE_URL}/remove-background)
- In-browser video compressor with quality levels or a target size in MB, MP4 output (${BASE_URL}/compress-video)
- High-resolution export up to ${PRODUCT_FACTS.maxExportScale}x scale (PNG, JPEG, WebP)
- One-click styling presets
- Aspect ratio presets for every social platform

## Standalone Image Tools

Single-purpose utilities that run entirely in the browser (Canvas plus Web Workers) and do not call any API. They need a signed-in Shots workspace and are included in every plan. Batch input is supported; several results download as one zip.

The editor utility endpoints under paths such as \`/api/screenshot\` require a signed-in session or a workspace API key with the artifact:read scope in \`X-API-Key\`, and per-IP limits apply on top. Create a workspace API key in Settings → Developer API (/workspace/developers). Workspace-scoped \`/api/v1\` operations require an organization key in \`X-API-Key\` or an authorized signed-in session. Every error is JSON with a stable \`code\`, a \`message\`, and a \`hint\`. Any page also serves Markdown when the request sends \`Accept: text/markdown\`.

No official CLI tool and no MCP server are published yet. Use the HTTP API described at ${BASE_URL}/docs.

> Shots is an open-source launch platform. It reads a software release, writes a cited launch brief, designs on-brand visuals, and drafts posts, and nothing ships until a person approves. It also includes a screenshot editor and browser-based image tools in every plan. Every plan is paid, and a signed-in workspace with an active subscription is required for everything; exports have no watermark.

## What is Shots?

Shots is a paid launch platform; there is no free plan. A release, typed in, sent through the API, or delivered by a GitHub, GitLab, or custom webhook, becomes a launch brief where every claim cites a source, a campaign plan, visuals rendered with the workspace brand kit, and channel copy for X, LinkedIn, Instagram, Product Hunt, the changelog, and email. Every post needs a human approval before it can be scheduled. Launch intelligence is in early access for design partners (${BASE_URL}/design-partners).

Shots also includes a browser-based screenshot editor in every plan, with no watermark. Editing runs in the browser, so imported images are not uploaded to edit them; saved designs are stored in the workspace, and export compression round-trips the finished image through the server without storing it. It is open source and available at https://github.com/PlaybookMediaLLC/screenshot-studio.

The editor is an open-source alternative to Pika Style, Shots.so (a separate product), and CleanShot X for images on social media, landing pages, documentation, and presentations.

## Developer and API Reference

### Discovery

| Resource | URL | Format |
|----------|-----|--------|
| API Documentation | ${BASE_URL}/docs | HTML |
| Developer Portal | ${BASE_URL}/developers | HTML |
| Interactive API Reference | ${BASE_URL}/api-reference | HTML |
| OpenAPI Specification | ${BASE_URL}/openapi.json | OpenAPI 3.1 JSON |
| API Authentication and Rate Limits | ${BASE_URL}/docs/authentication | HTML |
| llms.txt | ${BASE_URL}/llms.txt | Markdown |
| llms-full.txt | ${BASE_URL}/llms-full.txt | Markdown |
| Sitemap | ${BASE_URL}/sitemap.xml | XML |
| robots.txt | ${BASE_URL}/robots.txt | text |

### Authentication

The editor utility endpoints require a signed-in session or a workspace API key with the artifact:read scope in \`X-API-Key\`; a request with neither returns 401 with code \`unauthorized\`. A workspace without an active paid plan gets 403 with code \`workspace_feature_not_entitled\`; there is no free plan. Create a workspace API key in Settings → Developer API (/workspace/developers). Per-IP limits apply on top: \`POST /api/screenshot\` allows 20 requests per minute per IP and answers 429 with \`Retry-After\` and \`X-RateLimit-*\` headers. Workspace-scoped \`/api/v1\` operations require an organization key in \`X-API-Key\` or an authorized signed-in session, plus the declared permission, scope, feature, and quota checks.

### Endpoints

| Operation ID | Method | Path | Description |
|--------------|--------|------|-------------|
| captureScreenshot | POST | /api/screenshot | Capture a live URL as a base64 PNG |
| optimizeExportImage | POST | /api/export | Recompress an image as PNG, JPEG, or WebP |
| getTweet | GET | /api/tweet/{id} | Fetch a tweet payload by status ID |
| proxyTwitterImage | GET | /api/image-proxy | Same-origin proxy for Twitter media |
| getOpenApiSpec | GET | /openapi.json | This API's OpenAPI 3.1 document |
| getLlmsTxt | GET | /llms.txt | Markdown site overview |
| getLlmsFullTxt | GET | /llms-full.txt | Full Markdown reference |

### Error format

Every failing request returns JSON:

\`\`\`json
{
  "error": "URL is required",
  "code": "invalid_request",
  "message": "URL is required",
  "hint": "Send a JSON body with a url string.",
  "status": 400,
  "documentation": "${BASE_URL}/docs#errors"
}
\`\`\`

\`code\` is stable and safe to branch on. \`error\` and \`message\` carry the same human-readable text.

### Markdown content negotiation

Every page URL serves Markdown when the request prefers it:

\`\`\`
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" ${BASE_URL}/
\`\`\`

Responses set \`Content-Type: text/markdown; charset=utf-8\` and \`Vary: Accept, Accept-Encoding\`. A request that accepts neither \`text/html\` nor \`text/markdown\` is answered with 406. Unknown paths return 404 with a Markdown body listing where to look next.

### CLI and MCP

No official CLI tool and no MCP server are published yet. Agents should use the HTTP API above.

There is no free plan. A signed-in workspace is required on every plan. The screenshot editor and image tools are included in every plan, and exports have no watermark. Launch intelligence is in early access for design partners. Details: ${BASE_URL}/pricing

## Privacy

Editing and preview rendering happen in the browser, and imported images are not uploaded merely to edit them. Account and workspace operations use server-side tenant data. Export compression, URL capture, tweet import, and remote-image import send the data needed for those operations to the server or named providers. Authentication uses session cookies, configured analytics may use identifiers, and public pages may load Google AdSense. See ${BASE_URL}/privacy-policy for details.

## Use Cases

1. **Release Launches**: Turn a release into a cited launch brief, on-brand visuals, and posts that a person approves before they ship
2. **Social Media Graphics**: Create images for Twitter/X, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Product Hunt launches
3. **SaaS Screenshots**: Style product screenshots for landing pages, documentation, and app stores
4. **Developer Portfolios**: Show projects with framed screenshots
5. **Marketing Materials**: Create graphics for presentations, pitch decks, and ads
6. **Documentation**: Add framed screenshots to docs and READMEs
7. **Animated Content**: Create animated slideshows and export as video
