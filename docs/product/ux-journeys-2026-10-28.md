# Journey usability pass — 2026-10-28

Status: implemented and verified locally on branch `claude/dreamy-maxwell-akka5c`, based on `develop` at `c17da0c`. Nothing here was deployed or observed in production.

This pass walked the main journeys as a new and a returning user, fixed what blocked or misled them, and proved each fix with a browser test that fails on the previous code. It builds on the [October 26 audit](../computer-use-audit-2026-10-26.md) and the [information architecture implementation](ux-information-architecture-implementation.md); it does not repeat their findings.

Labels: **Observed** means seen in the browser on the local stack. **Source** means read in the code and not reproduced in the browser.

## Environment and method

- Local stack: `dev/native-stack` (Postgres, Redis, Temporal, Go API, `next dev`), plus the collaboration server started by hand (`clients/apps/collab-server`, so drafts can be written) and a local S3 emulator (moto) on the storage port, so assets can be uploaded. The render browser and the publishing orchestrator were not running.
- Accounts, all disposable and local: `dev@localhost.test` in the Pro workspace *Playbook Dev*; a second workspace *Journey Second* for the same person; a new user who signed up, created *Journey Fresh* and chose free basic scheduling; the same new user added to *Playbook Dev* as a Read-only (viewer) member.
- Browser: Playwright Chromium, driven by scripts. Desktop 1440 × 900, mostly in the dark theme (the final search capture is light); phone 390 × 844 with touch (coarse pointer) in the light theme.
- No provider was connected, nothing was published, purchased or deleted outside the test accounts, and no customer data was used.

### Test matrix

| Journey | New user (free) | Returning (Pro owner) | Read-only member | Phone, touch, light |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Get started: sign up, workspace, plan, first task | Observed | — | — | — |
| Create a post: start, write, leave, find, reopen | Observed | Observed | — | — |
| Create a visual: start, change, save, leave, find, reopen | Pro badge only | Observed | — | — |
| Templates: choose one and start from it | — | Observed | — | — |
| Find and reuse: search, recent work, asset into a post | — | Observed | — | Search observed |
| Restricted actions: plan and role | Observed | — | Observed | — |
| Two tabs, workspace switched in one | — | Observed | — | — |
| New menu and search reach and size | — | Observed | — | Observed |

Not exercised in the browser here: review and approval states, scheduling, campaign hand-off (covered by the existing campaign and scheduling suites, which were not changed), Safari, physical devices and screen readers.

## Findings and fixes

Severity follows the brief: critical is wrong-workspace behaviour, data loss or a blocked essential journey; high is a common task blocked, misdirected or without recovery; medium works but is confusing or slow.

| ID | Severity | Task and start | Expected → actual (before) | Fix and owner | Regression test |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TAB-01 | Critical | Two tabs open; switch workspace in tab B, keep working in tab A | Tab A keeps working in its workspace → tab A still showed *Playbook Dev*, but everything it created landed in *Journey Second* (a project made from tab A got the other workspace's id). Observed. | A guard in the shell compares the page's workspace with the session's. On a mismatch it blocks the page and offers **Keep working in A** (switches back) or **Open B**. Switching workspace, opening a new one and accepting an invitation tell the other tabs at once; tab focus also rechecks. `components/platform-shell/WorkspaceTabGuard.tsx`, `lib/auth/client.ts` | `workspace-switching.spec.ts` › a tab left in another workspace… |
| NEW-01 | High | Save a screenshot project, then **New → Screenshot** | A clean canvas → the editor reopened the saved project (`?project=` in the address bar), so any change autosaved over it. Opened in a fresh tab, the old design showed unlinked and **Save as project** would duplicate it. Observed. | **New → Screenshot** and Create's **Polish a screenshot** open `/?start=new`. The editor saves and closes the open project, then starts a clean canvas. A design kept only in this browser is never replaced silently: a dialog offers **Keep editing** or **Replace with a new screenshot**. `lib/projects/session.ts` (`startNewDesign`), `components/projects/ProjectLoader.tsx` | `projects.spec.ts` › New → Screenshot starts a clean canvas…; `project-session.test.ts` |
| NEW-02 | High | **New → Post**, then start typing | The words go into the quick-compose box → the box opened unfocused because the closing menu returned focus to **New**, so the first words went nowhere and Space or Enter reopened the menu. Observed. | The quick-compose box is a modal: it takes focus and keeps it while it covers the page, then hands it to the draft's editor. The fix is in the shared box, so Publish's kind menu and command palette get it too (those two paths were not tested separately). `components/write/pending-draft.tsx` | `write-editing-regressions.spec.ts` › New → Post keeps the first words… |
| HOME-01 | High | Save work, go to another page, return to Home | The new work is listed → *Continue working* kept a 30-second cache, so it still said "Your work will appear here". Observed. | Home shows the last list at once and refreshes it on every visit. `components/platform-hub/RecentWork.tsx` | `platform-redesign.spec.ts` › saved work shows on Home right away… |
| TPL-01 | High | Home, Create or Library → **Use template** on a screenshot or layout template | The editor opens with that template → it opened the bare editor, which could be the previous project, with no template applied. Observed (link target) and in the browser. | Screenshot and layout templates open `/?start=new&template=<id>` and apply as previewed, with the sample screenshot marked so the editor offers **Upload your media**. Animated, store and workflow templates cannot be applied by link yet, so their buttons now say **Open editor**, **Open studio** and **New workflow**. `lib/design/templates.ts` (`templateStarter`), `components/platform-hub/TemplateCatalog.tsx` | `projects.spec.ts` (Use template); `design-document.test.ts` |
| ROLE-01 | High | Read-only member opens **New** or Home | Only what the role can create → New offered six creation actions; five ended on refusals such as "Your role can view canvases but not create them." with no next step. Home offered the same four starters. Observed. | New shows the actions the role cannot use as unavailable and names who can grant access; Home leaves those starters out and says why. Each item uses the permission its destination checks (`artifact:edit`, `release:create`, `workspace:update`); server checks are unchanged. `components/platform-shell/ShellActions.tsx`, `app/[locale]/home/page.tsx` | `role-permissions.spec.ts` (every role) |
| DUP-01 | Medium | **New → Post** when the first request's answer is lost | Retry returns the same draft → each retry created another draft. Source; the backend already accepted a `requestKey` for this. | Quick-create sends one `requestKey` for every try. | `write-editing-regressions.spec.ts` (one draft after a lost answer and a retry) |
| FIND-01 | Medium | Search (⌘K) for a screenshot or Canvas by name; open search with nothing typed | Search finds work, and an empty box offers recent work → it found places and drafts only; an empty box listed only places. Observed. | Search lists recent work when empty and finds posts, screenshots and canvases by name or words through their existing bounded, tenant-scoped lists (four each). The dialog says what it covers; a collection that fails says so. Home and search share one loader and cache. `components/platform-hub/work.ts`, `components/platform-shell/ShellActions.tsx` | `platform-redesign.spec.ts` › …search finds it by name, with failures named |
| FIND-02 | Medium | Recognise drafts on Home | Distinct names → several cards read "Untitled draft". Observed. | Untitled drafts are named by their opening words, as search already did. | Same as FIND-01 |
| REUSE-01 | Medium | Library → Assets → an image or video | Start a post with it → only **Use image in new design** existed; a post meant opening Publish, making a draft and attaching it again. Observed. | **Use in a new post** makes a draft that references the existing asset (no upload), through the same quick-create flow. Shown only where drafts are on and the role can write. `components/workspace/WorkspaceAssets.tsx` | `platform-redesign.spec.ts` › Library attaches an existing asset… |
| START-01 | Medium | Home → **Write a post** (new free user) | Start writing → it opened the drafts list, where **New draft** had to be found and clicked. Observed. | **Write a post** starts the post at once, as **New → Post** does. | Observed after the fix (script); role spec checks the starter's presence |
| TOUCH-01 | Medium | Phone: New menu items | 44 px targets → 32 px. Observed. | Menu items in shell overlays get the 44 px minimum on coarse pointers, like the shell's buttons. `components/platform-shell/platform-shell.css` | Observed: all six items 44 px |

Checked and left as they are (observed, no defect): a new user's sign-up → workspace → plan → Publish path; a free workspace landing on Home with Pro areas marked; the draft composer's "Connect an account to publish. You can write your draft now." with an in-place **Connect account**; **New → Post** inside a non-default publishing brand landing in that brand.

## How people start, find, continue and reuse work now

- **Start.** **New** offers what the role can make. **Screenshot** and **Use template** open a new design instead of the last project; **Post** and Home's **Write a post** open a draft with the cursor ready, and the first words are kept even if the request is retried.
- **Know where it is saved.** Opening something new never writes over a saved project. Work kept only in this browser is named as such before it can be replaced.
- **Find and continue.** Home lists what was just saved. Search opens with recent work and finds posts, screenshots and canvases by name; it says when part of the search failed.
- **Reuse.** A Library image or video starts a post without another upload.
- **Stay in the right workspace.** A tab that another tab moved to a different workspace stops and asks before anything is saved.

## Before and after

Same local stack, accounts and viewport before and after; captures in [`qa-evidence/2026-10-28/`](qa-evidence/2026-10-28/).

| Journey | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New → Screenshot after saving a project | Reopened the saved project ([01](qa-evidence/2026-10-28/01-before-new-screenshot-reopens-project.jpg)) | Clean canvas, project untouched ([02](qa-evidence/2026-10-28/02-after-new-screenshot-clean.jpg)); local work asks first ([03](qa-evidence/2026-10-28/03-after-replace-local-design.jpg)) |
| Use template | Bare editor | Template applied with **Upload your media** ([04](qa-evidence/2026-10-28/04-after-template-applied.jpg)) |
| Return to Home after saving | "Your work will appear here" ([05](qa-evidence/2026-10-28/05-before-home-misses-saved-work.jpg)) | Listed at once (e2e); search with recent work ([06](qa-evidence/2026-10-28/06-after-search-recent-work.jpg)) |
| Two tabs, workspace switched | No warning; writes went to the other workspace | Guard dialog ([07](qa-evidence/2026-10-28/07-after-stale-tab-guard.jpg)) |
| Read-only member opens New | Six live actions ([08](qa-evidence/2026-10-28/08-before-viewer-new.jpg)) | Unavailable items and who can help ([09](qa-evidence/2026-10-28/09-after-viewer-new.jpg)) |
| Phone, touch, light | 32 px menu items | 44 px ([10](qa-evidence/2026-10-28/10-after-phone-new-menu.jpg)); search ([11](qa-evidence/2026-10-28/11-after-phone-search.jpg)) |

## Tests and checks

Every new browser test was run against the previous code with the fixes removed and failed at the expected step (project reopened, no guard, quick box not focused, Home missing the project, no **Use in a new post**), then passed with the fixes.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| New and extended browser tests (production lane, local stack) | Passed: `workspace-switching` (stale tab), `projects` (New → Screenshot, local work, Use template), `write-editing-regressions` (New → Post focus and one draft after a lost answer), `platform-redesign` (Home freshness and search; asset → new post added to the Library attach journey), `role-permissions` (New and Home for every role) — ROLE_RESULT |
| Same tests on the previous code | The first five failed at the expected step (see above) |
| Existing specs that touch the changed screens (12 files, 44 tests: platform-redesign, projects, session-access, settings-usability, workspace-creation-dialog, workspace-settings, workspace-switching, write, typefully-free, shell-bootstrap, canvas-template-previews, editor-adversarial) | First run, three workers on `next dev`: 36 passed, 8 failed. In isolation: 5 were timeouts under load and passed; 1 was a regression from this change (the editor lost focus after **New draft** because the quick-compose box held focus one render too long), fixed and passing; 2 in `write.spec.ts` expect a connected account's handle (`@shots_x`) and fail the same way on the previous code, because the local stack runs no social API |
| Unit and contract tests (`npm test` in `clients/`) | UNIT_RESULT |
| `npm run quality:check` (format, ESLint with `--max-warnings=0`, typecheck, unit tests) | QUALITY_RESULT |
| Not run | The rest of the browser suite, the `dev-server` lane, `make check` in Docker, Go checks (no Go change), the RFC check (no RFC change), `make tenant-isolation` and `./dev/social-gate` (no tenancy rule or publishing change; the stale-tab guard is client-side and server checks are unchanged) |

## Remaining issues, by impact

1. **Medium: buying a plan does not return to the blocked task.** The plan page's **Choose a plan** opens Billing, and checkout returns there, so the `from` path is lost. Owner: `/upgrade` page and the checkout return in `web/lib/billing/`; carrying a validated return path through Stripe Checkout is a billing contract change, left out of this pass. Source.
2. **Medium: animated, store and workflow templates are chosen twice.** Their buttons now say where they go, but the editor does not take a template by link. Owners: the animation templates, the Store studio and `/workflows/new`. Source.
3. **Medium: the screenshot editor still opens for a Read-only member by direct link**, and **Save as project** fails only when pressed (the server refuses it). New and Home no longer lead there. Owner: `components/projects/ProjectMenu.tsx`. Source.
4. **Medium: templates with device mockups** start with the sample screenshot inside the device but the editor's **Upload your media** prompt only appears for screenshot-mode templates, because the device screens are not marked as sample media. Owner: `templateStarter` in `lib/design/templates.ts`. Source.
5. **Low: sign-in from a deep link to a paid page** keeps the path but not its query (for example `/canvas/new?recipe=…`), because `requirePaidPageAccess` is given bare paths. Source.
6. Still open from October 26: a public page at `/` for signed-out crawlers, and reconciling `company.md` (no free plan) with the shipped free basic scheduling.

## What this does and does not establish

- **Source implementation:** the changes listed above, on this branch.
- **Local verification:** the observed results and the tests above, on the native local stack with disposable accounts, Chromium only.
- **Not verified:** production or staging, Safari and Firefox, physical phones, screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA), browser zoom beyond the reflow checks of earlier passes, live social providers, export output and the render browser. Accessibility work here was limited to focus behaviour, dialog semantics, accessible names, touch target size and keyboard use of the changed controls; it is not an accessibility certification.
