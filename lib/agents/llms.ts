## What is Screenshot Studio?

Screenshot Studio is a free, browser-based screenshot editor that transforms plain screenshots into professional-quality graphics. Editing runs in the browser, so imported images are not uploaded to edit them; export compression round-trips the finished image through the server without storing it.

## Developer and API Reference

### Discovery

| Resource | URL | Format |
|----------|-----|--------|
| API Documentation | ${BASE_URL}/docs | HTML |
| Developer Portal | ${BASE_URL}/developers | HTML |
| OpenAPI Specification | ${BASE_URL}/openapi.json | OpenAPI 3.1 JSON |
| API Authentication and Rate Limits | ${BASE_URL}/docs/authentication | HTML |
| llms.txt | ${BASE_URL}/llms.txt | Markdown |
| llms-full.txt | ${BASE_URL}/llms-full.txt | Markdown |
| Sitemap | ${BASE_URL}/sitemap.xml | XML |
| robots.txt | ${BASE_URL}/robots.txt | text |

### Authentication

The public API needs no API key, token, or account. Requests are anonymous. Access is shaped by per-IP rate limits rather than credentials: \`POST /api/screenshot\` allows 20 requests per minute per IP and answers 429 with \`Retry-After\` and \`X-RateLimit-*\` headers.

### Endpoints

| Operation ID | Method | Path | Description |
|--------------|--------|------|-------------|
| captureScreenshot | POST | /api/screenshot | Capture a live URL as a base64 PNG |
| optimizeExportImage | POST | /api/export | Recompress an image as PNG, JPEG, or WebP |
| getTweet | GET | /api/tweet/{id} | Fetch a tweet payload by status ID |
| proxyTwitterImage | GET | /api/image-proxy | Same-origin proxy for Twitter media |
| getOpenApiSpec | GET | /openapi.json | This API's OpenAPI 3.1 document |
| getLlmsTxt | GET | /llms.txt | Markdown site overview |
| getLlmsFullTxt | GET | /llms-full.txt | Full Markdown reference |

### Error format

Every failing request returns JSON:

\`\`\`json
{
  "error": "URL is required",
  "code": "invalid_request",
  "message": "URL is required",
  "hint": "Send a JSON body with a url string.",
  "status": 400,
  "documentation": "${BASE_URL}/docs#errors"
}
\`\`\`

\`code\` is stable and safe to branch on. \`error\` and \`message\` carry the same human-readable text.

### Markdown content negotiation

Every page URL serves Markdown when the request prefers it:

\`\`\`
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" ${BASE_URL}/
\`\`\`

Responses set \`Content-Type: text/markdown; charset=utf-8\` and \`Vary: Accept, Accept-Encoding\`. A request that accepts neither \`text/html\` nor \`text/markdown\` is answered with 406. Unknown paths return 404 with a Markdown body listing where to look next.

### CLI and MCP

No official CLI tool and no MCP server are published yet. Agents should use the HTTP API above.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 with App Router
- **UI**: React 19, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI primitives
- **State**: Zustand with temporal (undo/redo)
- **Canvas**: HTML Canvas with modern-screenshot for rendering
- **Video**: FFmpeg WASM for browser-based encoding
- **Assets**: Cloudflare R2
- **i18n**: next-intl with 8 locales
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout

## Pricing

A free workspace plan is available, and some workspace capabilities require a higher plan. A signed-in workspace is required. Editor exports have no watermark.

## Privacy

Editing and preview rendering happen in the browser, and imported images are not uploaded merely to edit them. Account and workspace operations use server-side tenant data. Export compression, URL capture, tweet import, and remote-image import send the data needed for those operations to the server or named providers. Authentication uses session cookies, configured analytics may use identifiers, and public pages may load Google AdSense. See ${BASE_URL}/privacy-policy for details.

## Use Cases

1. **Social Media Graphics**: Create eye-catching images for Twitter/X, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Product Hunt launches
2. **SaaS Screenshots**: Beautify product screenshots for landing pages, documentation, and app stores
3. **Developer Portfolios**: Showcase projects with professional-looking screenshots
4. **Marketing Materials**: Create graphics for presentations, pitch decks, and ads
5. **Documentation**: Add polished screenshots to docs and READMEs
6. **Animated Content**: Create animated slideshows and export as video
