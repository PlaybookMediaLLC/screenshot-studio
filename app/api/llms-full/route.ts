## What is Screenshot Studio?

Screenshot Studio is a free, browser-based screenshot editor that transforms plain screenshots into professional-quality graphics. It runs entirely in the browser — your images are never uploaded to any server. It is open source and available at https://github.com/KartikLabhshetwar/stage.

Built as a free alternative to paid tools like Pika Style, Shots.so, and CleanShot X, Screenshot Studio is used by developers, marketers, and designers to create polished images for social media, landing pages, documentation, and presentations.
