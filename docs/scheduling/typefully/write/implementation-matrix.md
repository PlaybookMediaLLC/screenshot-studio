# Write: requirements-to-code coverage matrix

Tracks [the functional reconstruction](typefully-write-spec.md) (29 sections) and
[the verification checklist](typefully-write-build-checklist.md) (60 cases) against
Screenshot Studio's Write workspace ([RFC 042](../../../rfcs/042-write-workspace.md)).
It is kept with the code: a change that adds, removes or weakens a behavior updates
its row.

Status values:

- **Done**: implemented and covered by an automated test that ran green.
- **Done (fixture)**: implemented; verified against a recorded or fake provider only.
  The live provider call has not been exercised from this repository.
- **Blocked (live)**: needs credentials, a paid provider plan or an account we do not
  have; the fixture path is tested, the live one is not claimed.
- **Gated**: deliberately unavailable, with the exact reason shown in the product.
- **Deviation**: implemented differently from the reconstruction, on purpose; the row
  says why.
- **Partial**: part of the case is covered; the row says which part is not.
- **Implemented, untested**: the behavior is in the code but no automated test
  checks it yet.
- **Not built**: out of scope for this change; the row says why.

Columns: *Existing* is what the repository had before RFC 042; *FE* and *BE* are the
main web and Go locations; *Tests* names the tests that cover the row (Go tests run
against a migrated PostgreSQL with `PUBLISHING_TEST_DATABASE_URL`; `write-*.test.ts`
are TypeScript unit tests; `write.spec.ts` is the Playwright journey).

§10 note: LinkedIn mentions are looked up through the set's LinkedIn connection by the
company page's vanity name. LinkedIn's API gives this connection no people search, so
the picker says so and offers no guess; a person typed as text stays plain text.
