              Screenshot Studio combines a browser-based image editor with a workspace platform. An
              account and workspace membership are required to use the editor. We store the
              identity, session, membership, and workspace data needed to provide that service.

              Editing, compositing, and preview rendering happen on your device in the browser

              operations, export compression, URL capture, tweet import, and remote-image import
              send the data needed for those operations to our servers or the named providers below.
