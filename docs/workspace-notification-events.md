# Workspace activity event matrix

This catalogue is implemented in `server/internal/activity/events.go`. Each
entry represents a committed transition, not an audit record. All personal
channels require current membership and resource access; settings and membership
resources additionally require owner/admin access or ownership of the affected
record. Restricted events never reach shared Slack destinations.

Recipients are resolved from verified resource creators, requesters, owners,
thread participants and mentioned member IDs. “Approvers” means owner/admin or
approver; draft reviewers are owner/admin or publisher. “Operators” adds relevant
owners/admins to involved people. “Publishers” adds workspace publishers to the
requester/creator. “Creators” means creators attached to this resource or its
campaign, not every creator in the workspace. Human actors are excluded.

In-app defaults on for every entry. Email defaults on only for the two existing
campaign review categories (marked *); other email and Slack require workspace
configuration. Personal opt-outs and global channel availability take precedence.

Social sets (RFC 024) add three gates. Activity on a private set's drafts and
posts reaches only the set's owner and never a shared Slack channel. A person
can turn a publishing kind off for one set, stored in
`platform_notification_preference.social_sets`. A person's email switch
(`user_preference.emailNotifications`) turns off activity email in every
workspace; authentication and security email is unaffected. A reply reaches
the thread's participants; the draft's author hears about new comments as
`comment.on_your_draft`.

Existing event IDs for release ingestion, assets, source changes, deployments,
and campaign review are retained. New activity keys include stable operation,
revision, comment/mention, capture or run identities; repeated saves and delivery
replay are not new occurrences. The review `decided` events retain the committed
approval/rejection/change-request decision in payload metadata. Text, member
names and diagnostics are never copied into durable delivery receipts.

No multistage approval or recurring campaign automation exists to emit events.
See [operations and validation](workspace-notifications.md) for migration,
provider setup, uncertainty handling and rollout order.
