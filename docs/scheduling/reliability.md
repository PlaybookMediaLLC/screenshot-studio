# Scheduling reliability

Audit and implementation: 28 October 2026. This document covers scheduling
supported content from the composer, the Plan calendar and the batch dialog
through the Go backend, PostgreSQL, the Temporal post workflow and the
provider adapters. It records what was found, what changed, the failure
model the code now implements, and how to verify it. It is not a
live-provider certification; see [what was verified](#verification).

## The path

| Step | Owner | What it guarantees |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Review | `components/write/composer/schedule.tsx`, `components/plan/PlanWorkspace.tsx`, `components/write/bulk-schedule.tsx` | Content, destinations, the instant in its zone and offset, problems, and which queued posts a confirmation replaces |
| Contract | `lib/api/contracts/content-drafts.ts`, `lib/tenant/content-drafts.ts`, backend SDK | Each destination's payload is built from the stored draft at the confirmed version |
| Commit | `server/internal/product/content_draft_schedule.go` | One transaction: approval, eligibility, quota, one `scheduled_post` per destination, revision, audit and event |
| Durable work | `server/internal/temporalpublishing` | `PostWorkflowV2` per post (`post_<id>`), started on commit and by the once-a-minute dispatcher |
| Provider | `server/internal/social/tenantpublishing` | Media signed at send time; one provider mutation per attempt |
| Receipt | `publishing.Repository.Complete` | `PUBLISHED` only with the provider's post ID on a succeeded `publication_attempt` |

## States

| State a person sees | Stored as | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Draft | `content_draft` without `plannedFor` or posts | Nothing will publish |
| Planned | `content_draft.plannedFor` | A calendar position only. No `scheduled_post` exists, so nothing publishes when the time passes |
| Scheduled | `scheduled_post.status = SCHEDULED` | A durable publication job at `scheduledFor` |
| Overdue | `SCHEDULED`, more than 5 minutes past `scheduledFor` | Its worker is behind; it still publishes if it starts within the late window |
| Publishing | `PROCESSING` | A workflow claimed it; the provider call may be in flight |
| Published | `PUBLISHED` with `remotePostId` and `publishedAt` | The provider confirmed it |
| Failed | `FAILED` with `failureCode` | Definitively not published by this attempt; a person may retry |
| Needs check | `UNKNOWN_DELIVERY` | The provider may have published it. Never retried until a person reconciles it |
| Cancelled | `CANCELLED`, with `failureCode` when the worker cancelled it | Will not publish |

Each destination is its own `scheduled_post` with its own state, attempts
and receipt. A success on one destination never marks another.

## Findings

Each lead was reproduced with a failing test before it was fixed.

| Finding | Evidence before the fix | Impact | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The composer showed a client-guessed queue slot but sent only `queue: true` | `schedule.tsx` computed the slot from `upcomingSlots` and never sent `expectedQueueSlot` | The committed time could differ from the reviewed one with no warning | The dialog shows the backend's next free slot and sends it. The backend reserves exactly that slot or answers 409 `queue_slot_taken` with `nextQueueSlot`; the dialog shows the new slot and asks again |
| A refused batch row moved every later queue row | The backend required the expected slot to equal the *next* free slot; with row 10 refused, row 11 conflicted, and so on | One failure blocked the rest of a 50-draft batch | The expected slot must be free and a real slot; it no longer has to be the first free one |
| A retry at the same version with a different time replayed the old schedule | `replayDraftSchedule` matched only draft, destination and version | The person was told "Already scheduled" for a time they did not choose | Each post stores `scheduleIntent`, a fingerprint of the request's timing. A changed retry is a 409; the same retry replays. Posts queued before the column replay as before |
| Concurrent identical submits failed | Two submits raced to the unique key; the loser got `publishing resource already exists` | A double click looked like a failure | Scheduling a draft takes a transaction advisory lock on it; the second submit waits, then replays |
| The stored zone was always the set's | `SetScheduleTimeZone(set.TimeZone)` | A time chosen in another zone was shown in the wrong one | The zone the time was read in is stored |
| The calendar placed a natural-time post at its slot and said nothing else | Cards and the detail used `slotAt ?? scheduledFor`; the detail called the slot the "publication instant" | The actual instant, up to four minutes off, was invisible | Cards keep their slot position and add "publishes 9:02:37"; the detail shows slot, instant and zone |
| Calendar Unschedule cancelled every destination from one card | `MutateCalendar` cancels all of the draft's queued posts; the button said "Unschedule" | Cancelling one card silently cancelled other networks | The button names the scope ("Unschedule all 3 destinations") and the sheet lists them; per-destination cancel stays in the editor. Move already changed one destination and now says so |
| Rescheduling replaced all queued destinations without saying so | `cancelLiveDraftPosts` cancels every queued post; the dialog did not list them | A destination switched off was cancelled unannounced | Schedule and Publish now list each queued post they replace and mark those that will be cancelled |
| The calendar collapsed states | `PROCESSING` and `SCHEDULED` showed "Scheduled"; `UNKNOWN_DELIVERY` showed "Failed" | A post that may be live looked retryable | Planned, Scheduled, Overdue, Publishing, Published, Failed and Needs check, each filterable. The Write queue labels the same states and keeps overdue and unconfirmed posts from the last two days |
| Withdrawn approval did not stop a timed post | The worker never re-checked draft approval; only Publish now did | A post a reviewer sent back still published | The worker re-checks approval for the post's scheduled version and cancels it as `APPROVAL_REQUIRED` |
| Missing media cancelled a post with a generic reason | `CancelIneligible` with "workspace, connection, or approval…" | Not actionable | `FAILED` with `MEDIA_UNAVAILABLE`, nothing sent |
| No late-publication policy | A post whose worker was down for days published when it came back | Stale posts could appear far from their moment | See [late publication](#late-publication) |
| A receipt write could fail permanently | `Complete` had 3 attempts two minutes apart; then the workflow failed and the post stayed `PROCESSING` forever | A live post looked unpublished and nothing reconciled it | Outcome writes retry for 24 hours; the provider ID is logged first; a stalled post is settled (below) |
| Nothing recovered a post stuck in `PROCESSING` | Recovery listed only `SCHEDULED` posts | A lost workflow left a permanent "Publishing" | The dispatcher settles posts whose workflow run has closed |
| A failed workflow wakeup reported a failed schedule | The handler answered 503 after committing | People retried a schedule that had succeeded | The committed result is returned and the failure logged; the dispatcher starts the due post |

## Scheduling identity

- A post's idempotency key is `content-draft:<draft>:<connection>:v<version>`;
  scheduling bumps the draft version, so a deliberate new schedule names the
  new version and replaces the queued posts. Publish now and Reschedule are
  separate, explicit actions.
- A retry of the same version and the same timing replays the original posts
  and charges nothing. The same version with other timing is a 409. A
  request whose keys match only some existing posts is a 409.
- Queue reservations hold the set's advisory lock for the transaction. Two
  requests for one reviewed slot: one wins, the other gets 409 with the next
  free slot. Nothing is moved silently. When rescheduling, the preview still
  counts the draft's own queued slots as taken; the 409 after a conflict
  does not, since the reschedule frees them. Either way the person confirms
  the slot that is committed.
- Quota is charged inside the scheduling transaction and refunded if it does
  not commit. A replay charges nothing. Calendar moves never charge.
  Rescheduling at a new version charges for the new posts, as before.
- Calendar mutations keep their durable receipts, version checks and Undo.

## Time zones

The backend resolves a local time in its IANA zone, refuses a time the
clocks skip and asks which of a repeated hour (`earlier` or `later`). Each
post stores the UTC instant, the zone it was chosen in, its slot and its
natural offset. Changing the calendar's display zone changes presentation
only. A natural offset is derived from the draft, version and slot, so a
retry or recovery lands on the same instant.

## Failure model

| Failure | Behavior | Test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Validation fails | 4xx before any write; nothing scheduled or charged | `TestContentDraftScheduling`, batch case in `TestContentDraftScheduleReliability` |
| Commit succeeds, workflow start fails | Committed result returned; the once-a-minute dispatcher starts the due post (`DispatchDue`, `ListRecoverablePosts`) | `TestScheduleContentDraftReportsCommittedPostsWhenWorkflowWakeupFails`, `TestRecoverablePostsAreDueScheduledPostsInsideTheWindow` |
| Worker stops before the provider call | The post is `PROCESSING` without an open attempt. Once its run has closed, the sweep queues it again and it publishes once | `TestSchedulingThroughTemporal` "vanished before sending" |
| Provider refuses (4xx, 5xx without ambiguity) | `FAILED` with the provider's status; no automatic retry | `TestSchedulingThroughTemporal` "refusal" |
| Provider rate-limits (429) | Durable retry after `PUBLISHING_RETRY_DELAY`, up to `PUBLISHING_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | `TestSchedulingThroughTemporal` "rate limit" |
| Response lost after the provider may have accepted | `UNKNOWN_DELIVERY`; retry refused until a person reconciles it as live (with its URL) or not live | `TestSchedulingThroughTemporal` "lost response" |
| Provider accepted, receipt write fails | The write retries for 24 hours; the provider ID is in the worker log. If the run still closes, the sweep marks the post `UNKNOWN_DELIVERY`. It is never sent again | `TestSchedulingThroughTemporal` "receipt" |
| Destination or approval becomes ineligible | `CANCELLED` with `ACCOUNT_UNAVAILABLE`, `APPROVAL_REQUIRED` or `WORKSPACE_INACTIVE`; nothing sent | `TestSchedulingThroughTemporal` "withdrawn approval", `TestPrepareSendsOnlyEligibleOnTimePosts` |
| Media unavailable at send time | `FAILED` with `MEDIA_UNAVAILABLE`; nothing sent. A signing failure fails with 503, also before sending | `TestSchedulingThroughTemporal` "missing media" |
| Worker down past the time | Overdue after 5 minutes; published late within the window; `MISSED_WINDOW` after it | `TestSchedulingThroughTemporal` "late window", `TestPrepareSendsOnlyEligibleOnTimePosts` |
| Cancel races the provider call | The calendar refuses: "Publication has started or needs reconciliation"; the post finishes with its real result | `TestSchedulingThroughTemporal` "cancellation racing" |
| Thread stops after its root | The root stays `PUBLISHED` with its receipt and thread progress; "Post the rest" continues from the last live reply | Existing `a stopped thread resumes` case |

`PUBLISHED` always means a provider receipt. Shots does not promise
exactly-once delivery: a provider that accepted a post and lost the response
can leave a duplicate risk, which is why such posts wait for a person.

### Late publication

A post publishes late if its workflow starts it within one hour of
`scheduledFor` (`temporalpublishing.LatePublicationWindow`). After that it
is not sent: it fails as `MISSED_WINDOW` and the person publishes it now
(Retry) or reschedules it. A 429 retry moves `scheduledFor`, so the window
counts from the retry time. The card shows Overdue from five minutes late.

### Stalled publications

The `scheduled-posts` maintenance job first settles posts that have been
`PROCESSING` for 15 minutes without progress and whose workflow run is no
longer running in Temporal (a run ID Temporal never issued counts as not
running). An open attempt means the provider may have been called, so the
post becomes `UNKNOWN_DELIVERY` and operators are notified; no open attempt
means nothing was sent, so it is queued again. A sweep failure is logged and
never stops due posts from starting.

## Batch scheduling

The batch dialog takes up to 50 drafts from one publishing brand. It
previews queue or Spread times, validates every draft without writing, shows
each row's time and destinations, and asks before skipping blocked rows.
Rows are scheduled one at a time with their previewed slot. A refused row
stays blocked with its reason and can be previewed again without touching
scheduled rows; a row without an answer is retried with the same request,
which replays. All destinations of a draft share its time; per-destination
times are not offered.

## Data and rollout

`20261102130000_scheduled_post_intent.sql` adds two nullable columns to
`scheduled_post`: `scheduleIntent` and `failureCode`. Existing posts keep
`NULL`, replay by key and keep their reasons on their attempts. No backfill.

Deploy order: migration, then the API and worker together, then the web.
An old web without `expectedQueueSlot` keeps the previous queue behavior.
`PostWorkflowV2` histories recorded before this change replay on the new
code (`TestPostWorkflowV2ReplaysHistoriesFromBeforeRecordRetries`); only
activity options changed, which replay does not compare.

Rollback: redeploy the previous API, worker and web. The two columns are
ignored by older code and can stay. Posts that the new worker failed as
`MISSED_WINDOW` or cancelled as `APPROVAL_REQUIRED` stay so; retry them by
hand if wanted.

Behavior changes to announce: turning on "Require approval" now stops
queued, unapproved draft posts at their time, as the composer already says
("This workspace approves drafts before they publish"); a post more than an
hour late is no longer sent automatically.

## Operations

The worker logs, without credentials, signed URLs or post text:
`publication starting` (post, platform, `lateSeconds`), `provider accepted
publication` (post, platform, `remotePostId`), `publication missed its
window`, `publication failed before sending`, `publication cancelled as
ineligible`, and `stalled publication released`. `UNKNOWN_DELIVERY` emits
the existing `post.publish_recovery_required` notification.

Suggested targets to adopt after observing production, not current
promises: 99% of due posts start within 2 minutes; zero posts `PROCESSING`
for over 30 minutes; every `UNKNOWN_DELIVERY` reconciled within a day.

## Verification

Run from `server/` with disposable services (the native stack's Temporal
dev server works):

```bash
export PUBLISHING_TEST_DATABASE_URL='postgresql://postgres@127.0.0.1:55432/shared_cutover_test?sslmode=disable'
export PUBLISHING_TEST_TEMPORAL_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:7233
go test -count=1 ./internal/product -run 'TestContentDraftScheduleReliability|TestContentDraftScheduling|TestContentDraftPlatform|TestWritePublishing'
go test -count=1 ./internal/temporalpublishing ./internal/httpapi ./internal/publishing
```

The interface was checked in the running app (`dev/native-stack`) with
seeded posts in every state: calendar states and the natural-time instant,
the unschedule scope, the composer's reviewed slot and replaced posts, the
per-destination reasons, and a live conflict in which a second request took
the reviewed slot and the dialog showed the next one. The native stack runs
no publishing worker, so worker outcomes there were seeded in the database;
the worker itself is covered by the Temporal test below.

`TestSchedulingThroughTemporal` drives product scheduling, real PostgreSQL,
`PostWorkflowV2` on a real Temporal server and an in-process fake provider.
It needs `PUBLISHING_TEST_TEMPORAL_ADDRESS`, which CI does not set, so CI
skips it. It proves application behavior, not provider delivery: no request
reaches a social network, and it does not hold a post for 24 real hours.
Live canaries remain as listed in
[social publishing verification](../social-publishing-verification.md).
