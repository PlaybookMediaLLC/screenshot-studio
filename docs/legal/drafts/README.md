# Legal document drafts

> **DRAFT — requires counsel review.** These files are proposals, not legal advice. Do not publish
> them. Nothing here changes the live pages. The owner must approve each document before release.

## Summary

- These drafts replace the live Terms and Privacy Policy, and they correct the Security page.
- They also add the documents that a B2B platform with workspaces, SSO, SCIM, and AI needs.
- The facts in each draft come from the code at commit `bad06b3e` (2026-10-17).
- A `[[PLACEHOLDER]]` marks each fact that the code cannot prove. Counsel or the owner must fill it.
- A "⚑ Requires product change Pn" note marks a promise that the product does not keep yet. Do not
  publish that clause until the change ships, or remove the clause.

## How to review

1. Read the summary at the top of each draft.
2. Read the redline table. It shows each change from the live page and the reason.
3. Fill the placeholders.
4. Decide each "⚑ Requires product change" clause: keep it and wait, or remove it.
5. Approve the text. Then an engineer moves it into the live page in a separate change.
